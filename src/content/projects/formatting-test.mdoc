Hi, my name is Arianna Moore. I am currently a Graphic Design BFA student, and I have an Associates degree in Fine Arts. I have interned at SUNY Ulster in their community relations department. During my time there I have made flyers, newspaper advertisements, brochures, and more. I also have experience in traditional art and using media such as graphite, charcoal, gouache, and acrylic paints. Lastly, I have experience in digital photography and digital manipulation.&nbsp;
